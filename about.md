# About me

# My name

I tend to pronounce my first name <span class="text-ipa">['hɛnrɪsən]</span>, which kind of sounds like "Harrison" but with "Henry" instead of "Harris".
People sometimes mishear my name as "Harrison".

My last name is easy if you know how to say "Thank you" in Mandarin Chinese (謝謝/谢谢) because it is simply the unreduplicated form of that expression.
In Mandarin, it's <span class="text-ipa">[ɕje]</span>, but <span class="text-ipa">[ʃɛ]</span> or <span class="text-ipa">[ʃjɛ]</span> are fine approximations in English.
To those unfamiliar with IPA, I usually say: "Shh" followed by a "Yeah".

The spelling I ended up with comes from the Wade-Giles romanization system, which used to be the standard for scholarly work on Mandarin Chinese, and seems to roughly be the standard for the romanization of surnames of many people from Taiwan.
If my father had come from elsewhere in the Sinosphere, I could have been Henrison Xie, Henrison Tze, or Henrison Sia, to name a few possibilities.
