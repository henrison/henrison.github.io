# Welcome!
{{ site.description }}

My dissertation investigates the structure and distribution of A'-dependencies (relative clauses, _wh_-questions, etc.) in Tagalog by considering a wider ranged of data than in previous work.

My work primarily draws on elicitation and fieldwork data from native speaker (and my own) judgements, but I am always on the lookout for ways to incorporate larger amounts of data using experimental and/or computational methods.

## Recent and upcoming
- July 2021: My paper with [Luis Alonso-Ovalle](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~luis.alonso-ovalle) in Journal of Semantics entitled [_Causes and expectations: On the interpretation of the Tagalog Ability/Involuntary Action form_](https://doi.org/10.1093/jos/ffab008) has now been published!
- May 2021: I gave a talk at [AFLA 28](https://lingconf.com/afla28) entitled _Matters of locality in exceptional Tagalog Aâ€²-extraction_
- Jan 2021: I have joined the [Syntax/Semantics Lab](https://mitcho.com/lab/) at the National University of Singapore as a Postdoctoral Fellow!
- Sept 2020: I successfully defended my PhD dissertation entitled _Beyond Nominative: A Broader View of A'-dependencies in Tagalog_! If you would like to read my thesis, it is available on [lingbuzz](https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/005856).
