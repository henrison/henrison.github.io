{{ site.description }}

My dissertation investigates the structure and distribution of A'-dependencies (relative clauses, _wh_-questions, etc.) in Tagalog by considering a wider ranged of data than in previous work.

My work primarily draws on elicitation and fieldwork data from native speaker (and my own) judgements, but I am always on the lookout for ways to incorporate larger amounts of data using experimental and/or computational methods.
