  <p>
    My dissertation investigates the structure and distribution of A'-dependencies (relative clauses, <i>wh</i>-questions, etc.) in Tagalog by considering a wider ranged of data than in previous work.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work primarily draws on elicitation and fieldwork data from native speaker (and my own) judgements, but I am always on the lookout for ways to incorporate larger amounts of data using experimental and/or computational methods.
