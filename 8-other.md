# Charte montréalaise des droites et responsabilités
In 2017, I was approached by Prof. James Archibald in the School of Continuing Studies at McGill to collaborate on translating the _Charte montréalaise des droites et responsabilités_ 'Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities' into Tagalog/Filipino, to coincide with Philippine Independence Day that year.

The Charter, which is available in several languages, can be found on the [City of Montréal website](https://montreal.ca/en/topics/montreal-charter-rights-and-responsibilities).
An article with some background on the Charter and the translation appeared in the McGill Reporter (in French): [_Les droits et responsabilités des Montréalais en tagalog (!), langue nationale des Philippines_](https://reporter.mcgill.ca/les-droits-et-responsabilites-des-montrealais-en-tagalog-langue-nationale-des-philippines/).


# Python stuff
Here is a (now stalled) procrastination project I worked on for a bit

Here are some of the source files for previous presentations of mine, if you're learning LaTeX and would like to mess around with someone else's code.
All files are provided as is, and may or may not compile totally correctly on your machine.
- [Bibliography.bib](/files/latex/Bibliography.bib): Not technically necessary to compile the other files, but you need this if you want the citations in the other files to compile properly.
- [SEALS 28 Slides](/files/latex/seals28-slides.tex): Slides for my SEALS 28 presentation ([Output PDF](/files/latex/seals28-slides.pdf))
- [Overleaf file](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nqcbtwcnmvmk): Document that was projected during the LaTeX workshop co-hosted my McGill SLUM and Concordia LSA (07 Nov 2018)
